Exercise 1: Application of data analysis

K-nearest neighbors and cross-validation
- Program your own implementation of kNN. Preferably with python.
- Select a data set of your chouse from the UCI machine learning repository: \url{http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/}
- Use cross-validation on the training set and report the performance (e.g. classification or regression error) for different values of $k$

Phases: 
1. Parse data: Divide data into test and train sets.
2. Similarity: Calculate the distances data instances.
3. Neighbors: Locate k most similar data instances.
4. Response: Generate a response from a set of data instances.
5. Accuracy: Summarize the accuracy of predictions.
